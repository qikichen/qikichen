# About Me :wave:

Hi I am Qiki, I am a Research Engineer at Barcelona Supercomputing Center, I also graduated with Masters in Computer Science from the University of Edinburgh and a degree in Theoretical Physics from the University of Manchester. I am interested in High Performance Computing, Computer Architecture and AI. Besides that I am also an avid fan of Volleyball and Music. I undertook a project in the Modeling of Language Evolution using Statistical Physics, which is a research field in Complex Systems and Statistical Physics, for my Bachelor Dissertation project where I have decided to do the optional simulations. Currently working on AI Systems and Vector Databases where I contributed in the development of Clustering Algorithms and now am developing a Vector Databse Indexing Algorithm and Benchmarking.
