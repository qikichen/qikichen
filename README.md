# Who is Qiki?

Hi I am Qi Nohr Chen (but please call me Qiki), I am a Physics with Theoretical Physics graduate from the University of Manchester and currently a Masters Student in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh.
I am intrested in Large Scale Software Systems, Complex Systems and Statistical Physics, Non-Linear Dynamics, Quantum Mechanics, Probability and Stochastic. Besides that I am also an avid fan of Volleyball and Music
I undertook a project in the Modeling of Language Evolution using Statistical Physics, which is a research field in Complex Systems and Statistical Physics and also my Bachelor Dissertation project where I have decided to do the optional simulations. 
I am looking to collaborate on projects involving simulations in physics, quantitative finance or even machine learning. I am always willing to learn more!
